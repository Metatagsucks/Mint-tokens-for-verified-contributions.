# Proof of Contribution (PoC) Token

## 📜 Description
The **Proof of Contribution (PoC) Token** is a digital asset designed to recognize and verify an individual's participation, effort, and value-added contributions within a project, community, or ecosystem. Unlike traditional rewards, PoC tokens focus on the *quality* and *impact* of contributions rather than mere participation. Each token acts as verifiable proof, recorded on a blockchain to ensure transparency, immutability, and authenticity.

Key features:
- Represents contributions like technical development, research, content creation, mentorship, and governance.
- Can be soulbound (non-transferable) to ensure recognition remains tied to the original contributor.
- Enhances reputation, grants voting rights, and provides access to exclusive opportunities in decentralized ecosystems.
